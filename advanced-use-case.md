# ðŸŽ“ Advanced use-case

Since RedisChat doesn't rely on the proxy (but behaves like it is), the plugin has a lot of applications:

Multi-proxy - use RedisChat to **sync chats through different proxy servers**. Ex. proxy 1 has a spigot1 server and proxy2 has a spigot2 server. You can sync those 2 spigot servers simply by setting the same Redis server address/URI

Multiple multi-spigot servers - You have a skyblock with 200 spigot instances and a survival with 4 instances. You can synchronize skyblock server's chats by setting the same **cluster-id** and the same with survival instances

Single spigot - using it on a single instance is the simpler setup. It is recommended to use Redis anyway but it is possible to set a Mysql storage or file storage for RedisChat data
