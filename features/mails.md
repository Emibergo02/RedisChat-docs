# ðŸ“§ Mails

## Commands

### /rmail playerName mailTitle (or /mail playerName mailTitle)

You can use it with `redischat.mail.write` permission.&#x20;

After you execute this command there would be a clickable message in chat

That message links to a [**web editor**](https://webui.advntr.dev/) where you can modify your mail with MiniMessage format

When you finished the editing click on the save button.

Clicking on that button will copy a command to run in the console

Run that command and confirm sending the mail

## /rmail

Executing only /rmail opens a GUI with all your mails
