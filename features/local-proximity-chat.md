# ðŸ”– Local "Proximity" chat

To create a local chat use

### **/channel create local 3 5 true \<distance>**

**local** would be the name of the local channel

[**3** and 5 are the rate-limit and rate-limit-seconds parameters](channels/#channel-create-less-than-channelname-greater-than-less-than-rate-limit-greater-than-less-than-rate-l)

**true** is the filter parameter (if the chat should be filtered through the regex-blacklist list inside config.yml)

**\<distance>** is the maximum distance for a local message to reach the recipient

A distance equal to or lower than 0 would disable the proximity feature.

If you want to have a chat for the whole server/world set distance to 2000000000
