# ‚≠ê Staff chat

### /staffchat \<message>

You can use staffchat and read staffchat messages with **`redischat.staffchat`** permission.&#x20;

#### There is also a **shortcut** for staffchat: add **`!`** at the start of your message to send that message into staffchat (the prefix is editable in config.yml)
